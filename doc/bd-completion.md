# `bd-completion.sh`: Bash Completion for the `bd` Command

The `bd-completion.sh` script is a auxiliary module for the `bd.sh` autoloader. It provides Bash completion capabilities for the `bd` command.

## Purpose

This script significantly boosts the usability of the `bash-d` system by making it more intuitive and accessible through Bash tab-completion. It enables intelligent tab-completion for the `bd` command and its subcommands in a Bash shell. It dynamically suggests options and arguments based on the current input context.

## Integration with `bd.sh`

* Relies on the presence of the `bd` environment and directory structure (e.g., BD_AUTOLOAD_DIR) for proper operation.
* Complements other `bd` components by making their functionality more accessible and user-friendly.

## Key Features

### Initialization and Safety Checks:

* Prevents direct execution, ensuring the script is only sourced (source bd-completion.sh).

### Dynamic Completion Logic:

* Implements `_bd_completion`, a function registered with Bash's complete command to handle tab-completion for the `bd` command.
* Identifies the current word being typed (`COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD]`) and provides suggestions based on context.

### Subcommand and Argument Suggestions:

* Provides completions for the following primary subcommands:
	* `dir`: Suggests actions like `hash` and `ls` for directory-related operations.
	* `env`: Dynamically lists available environment variables (via `bd env`).
	* `snippet`: Suggests snippet actions like `get`, `hash`, `ls`, and `rm`.
		* For `rm`, lists available snippets in the designated `BD_SNIPPET_DIR`.
* Handles general subcommands, including help, license, upgrade, and functions.

### Fallback and Default Behavior:

* If no specific subcommand or argument is matched, the script falls back to providing a list of general `bd` subcommands: `dir`, `env`, `functions`, `help`, `license`, `snippet`, and `upgrade`.
* Gracefully returns no suggestions for invalid or unrecognized inputs.

## How It Works

* The script uses `compgen` to generate potential completions based on predefined lists or dynamically retrieved data.
* Subcommands like `env` and `snippet` fetch their arguments on-the-fly, ensuring the completion suggestions reflect the current state of the environment.

## Use Cases

* Interactive Shell Users: Enhances productivity by reducing the need to remember exact subcommands and options for `bd`.
* Developers: Simplifies testing and exploration of `bd` functionality during development.
* System Administrators: Provides quick access to `bd`'s capabilities, such as managing snippets or environment variables.

## Notable Strengths

* Context-aware suggestions ensure relevance to the user's current input.
* Dynamic fetching of data (e.g., environment variables, snippets) enhances accuracy and usability.
* Clean integration with Bash's native completion system using `complete -F`.
